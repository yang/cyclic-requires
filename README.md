cyclic-requires
===============

This is an extremely simple script to scan your CoffeeScript node modules for
cyclic require calls.

This was thrown together because the only other promising tool, [madge], was
just not working.  Furthermore, cyclic requires can sometimes be perfectly
fine, so long as they are "late-bound" and run within some function rather than
during the initial top-level module loading phase that most applications are
structured withâ€”hence this tool ignores nested require calls.

This tool doesn't even do any parsing of the sources, but instead just uses
regular expressions.  This has actually worked great for a number of projects
I've applied it to.

It should be easy to tweak this script to work for JavaScript as well.
